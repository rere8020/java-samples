Three types of variables in Java
1. local- used within a method, constructor or block of code and
destroyed from memory when leaving code block. We can't use access modifiers with local
variables. Must be initialized before we can use them.
2. instance- Variables which are outside of method, block of code or constructor but within a class.
They are instance variables because they belong to the instance of the class. They can have different
values of all the objects in that class. Should avoid using as they stay in memory. Can use instance modifiers private,default,
protected. Instance values get assigned default values.
3. static- Declared outside outside of method, constructor or block of code. Use static keyword to specify the type.
Static variables only allocate memory in one location, objects use the same memory location. We should use when a variable is common
to all objects.
